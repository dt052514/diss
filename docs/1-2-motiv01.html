<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>This section has three primary objectives. First, it provides a brief introduction to national oil companies (NOCs) and situates them within existing political economy and business studies research, touching on general approaches but focusing in particular on the studies that aim to improve our understanding of internationalization in particular. In this discussion, our aim is to clearly establish the importance of NOC internationalization as an area of study for political economists. Second, as part of this literature review, we aim to establish the state of empirical research into the NOC internationalization as transparently as possible, establishing the need for and value of the novel data this paper introduces in the subsequent section. Third, this section introduces a number of open empirical questions concerning NOC internationalization that have to this point not been adequately addressed. These questions form the basis for the analysis developed in Section <a href="1-4-analysis01.html#analysis01">1.4</a>.</p>
<div id="what-are-national-oil-companies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> What are National Oil Companies?</h3>
<p>National Oil Companies (NOCs) are firms that operate in the hydrocarbon sector and are wholly or partially owned by the state.<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> The cut-point for minority state ownership is 30% state ownership (such as Italy’s ENI). Most NOCs are 100% state-owned. NOCs are a specific kind of state-owned enterprise (SOE).</span> NOCs are geographically dispersed, though they are more dominant in some regions than in others. There are 88 NOCs currently in operation.</p>
<p>NOCs are generally primarily responsible for the stewardship and development of domestic oil and gas reserves. Out of the top 10 countries raked by proven crude oil reserves, Canada is the only state without an NOC.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> <a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/data/browser/#/?pa=0000000000000000000008&amp;c=ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1urvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvnvvuvo&amp;ct=0&amp;tl_id=5-A&amp;vs=INTL.57-6-AFG-BB.A&amp;cy=2018&amp;vo=0&amp;v=H&amp;start=1980">U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 Statistics</a>. Canada established a wholly owned oil &amp; gas crown corporation, Petro Canada, in 1975, and initiated privatization in 1990. The government divested its remaining 19% stake in 2004, and Petro Canada is now owned by Suncor Energy.</span> NOCs can take primary responsibility for resource extraction (drilling, etc.) though some also contract these activities out to third parties (other large oil &amp; gas firms). Many NOCs also operate at other points in the hydrocarbon value chain, including refining, transportation (shipping and pipelines), and even consumer sales (Mexico’s PEMEX, for instance, has a national chain of vehicle gas stations). NOCs are not restricted to operating in the oil &amp; gas sectors, either: some own subsidiaries or investment arms that operate in very different commercial sectors such as electricity grid management, or real estate. NOCs can be the most significant contributor to the economy and the largest employer, as in the case of Saudi Arabia’s Saudi Aramco; others feature regularly in state-to-state diplomatic exchanges, as in the case of Russia’s Gazprom. Others invest heavily in brand placement, such as Malaysia’s Petronas and its Formula One sponsorship.</p>
<p>Just as NOCs vary in terms of their operations and corporate focus, they vary with respect to the practicalities of state-ownership as well. Many operate under the purview of a Ministry of Energy, where ultimate authority for the firm’s operations rests on an elected (or appointed) government minister. Others slot into a bureaucratic function and are insulated from elected decision-makers. Still others see their boards and leadership positions staffed by close associates or family members of a ruling clan, or serve as patronage opportunities for loyalists. States may have an interest in actively managing the affairs of the firm, or may prefer to let the firm work at arms-length from political functions so that it can operate as a purely economic actor.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> What do we know about NOCs?</h3>
<p>Academic research into NOCs can be roughly grouped into four categories. First, scholarship across several disciplines has sought to address the question of why NOCs exist in the first place. The earliest of these focus on the historical genesis of NOCs as oil supply managers and evolution into production and export businesses. Many focus on explaining why states rely on state-owned firms instead of a competitive market for production and distribution <span class="citation">(eg. Tordo <label for="tufte-mn-12" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-12" class="margin-toggle">2011<span class="marginnote">Tordo, Silvana. 2011. “National Oil Companies and Value Creation, V.1.” <em>World Bank Working Paper</em>, World Bank Working Papers, 218 (July). <a href="http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-0-8213-8831-0">http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-0-8213-8831-0</a>.</span>)</span>.

Mitchell. 2006. <em>Oil Titans: National Oil Companies in the Middle East</em>. London: Brookings Institution Press.</span>)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, a body research — developed in particular, but not exclusively, by applied economists — has investigated the economic activity of NOCs. Many of these studies examine and compare the efficiency and effectiveness of NOCs as economic entities, particularly in relation to non-state owned peers <span class="citation">(eg.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> NOC internationalization: opportunities for research</h3>
<p>We can draw at least three conclusions from this survey.</p>
<p>First, there is no good reason for the neglect of National Oil Companies in political science research. They sit in a key place, substantively and theoretically, for some of the most important topics in the field (the resource curse, energy security). As institutions, they marry political and economic influences and processes in a variety of organizational forms, and continue to be the most salient and influential evidence of robust state capitalism in the contemporary economy. When we consider their international expansion in particular, as an set of activity it is substantial enough to have made a major impact on the global market for oil &amp; gas, and instances of NOC investment regularly receive intense scrutiny from the popular press and from political actors themselves. Scholars in adjacent disciplines have built a robust literature explaining NOC internationalization with reference to a set of explicitly political variables of interest.</p>
<p>Second, our empirical understanding of NOCs, and NOC internationalization in particular, can and should be improved. The bulk of existing research, regardless of discipline is built on single-country analyses or small-n case comparisons. As such, the generalizability of many of the arguments and theories this research puts forward has yet to be meaningfully evaluated. This empirical weakness, driven primarily by the lack of high quality cross-national data on the subject, is likely a contributor to the fact that political economists have yet to devote serious attention to NOC internationalization (with a few exceptions).</p>
<p>Third, the NOC internationalization research agenda can and should be broadened beyond explaining that internationalization. Detailed investigations in to the causes for internationalization have come at the cost of at least two complementary focuses: on internationalization itself, and efforts to better understand its features and how it varies; and on the political and economic consequences of that internationalization for the firm, the state-owner, and the target market. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the first of these topics. Chapters 2 and 3 address the second.</p>
<p>The figure below schematically captures these conclusions in the context of the survey. The Y axis varies in terms of the research approach taken (single country or small n). The X axis varies in terms of the research focus (Explaining NOC Internationalization) vs Explaining the Impact of NOC Internationalization):</p>

</div>
<p>In subsequent sections I introduce and then explore a new dataset, one that leverages corporate hierarchy data captured in financial databases to develop a rigorous view into the structure of the international hydrocarbon market, including but not limited to NOCs. I then utilize this dataset to investigate a set of questions that build our foundational knowledge of NOC internationalization. As such, the goal of this paper is to contribute to the lower left quadrant in the schematic above (c). Subsequent chapters in this research project contribute to both the upper and lower right of the schematic above (b and d).</p>
