<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Empirical Approach: NOC Subsidiary Networks</h2>
<p>I gain leverage over NOC internationalization by examining the subsidiary network of each firm and identifying both domestic and international investments and/or operating units. In this dataset the unit of observation is the subsidiary firm. These data are a substantial improvement over previous datasets used in the literature, which in general focus on transactions (mergers &amp; acquisitions as well as asset purchases) as the unit of analysis. A more direct discussion of these data compared to alternatives is provided in the following subsection. Below I introduce the data source, discuss the data collection process, describe some features of the dataset, and identify the advantages of these data over alternatives.</p>
<p>The base source for all firm level data is Standard &amp; Poor’s <em>Capital IQ</em>, a financial services database which provides company profile information about several hundred thousand businesses worldwide. I extracted ‘corporate tree’ information for all NOCs identified above using Capital IQ’s report-builder function.<label for="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">11</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">11</span>  S&amp;P Capital IQ. (2017). <em>Various Company Profiles</em>. Retrieved April 15-18, 2017, from S&amp;P Capital IQ database.</span> A firm’s corporate tree identifies all direct subsidiaries, wholly or partially owned. I collected corporate tree data for all 88 parent NOCs identified, producing a dataset of 7,005 observations (where each row is a subsidiary of a specific NOC). Because the headquarters location is coded for both parent and subsidiary, differentiating between domestic and international subsidiaries is straightforward. In addition to identifying the parent and the subsidiary business names, the corporate tree data also indicates whether the subsidiary is an investment or an operating unit, and whether or not the parent has a majority or minority stake in the subsidiary.</p>
<p>I repeated this process to build a dataset of comparable non-state owned energy firms (for simplicity, referred to as international oil companies (IOCs) for the remainder of this document).<label for="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">12</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">12</span> IOCs is technically a misnomer, as at least a few of the firms included in the analysis only operate domestically.</span> Whereas the NOCs identified represent the universe of NOCs, the potential pool of eligible IOCs is much larger. To simplify the case selection process, I use the FTSE Global Oil &amp; Gas Index, comprised of major energy firms world wide. After removing several NOCs included in the index I am left with a set of 120 firms.</p>
<p>The combined dataset has a total of 24,724 subsidiaries distributed across 190 parents. Variables coded at the firm level include parent name, subsidiary name, subsidiary type, ownership stake, parent country, subsidiary country, parent founding year, parent employee count. Because both parent and subsidiary locations are coded, the resulting dataset is a rich set of bilateral links that can be easily mapped to state-level features of both the parent and subsidiary (polity scores, GDP/capita, etc.). A reproducible workflow for transforming these data following the initial ‘report-builder’ extract can be found in Appendix <a href="#appa"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A key benefit of the Capital IQ corporate tree data is that the heavy lifting of collecting data has already been done, and has been performed using a range of sources including but not limited to corporate securities filings, annual reports, press releases, and news reports. This range of information provides a broader scope than a single researcher might be able to secure. One important limitation of these data is that they are cross-sectional rather than time-series. While I have information on the founding year for most parents, I have not collected that data for subsidiaries. As such, the data provide a static view of the current state of each corporate tree.</p>
<p>How does this dataset of NOC subsidiaries compare to other efforts to gain leverage over NOC internationalization? As discussed in the previous section, empirical efforts to capture and analyze NOC internationalization have been limited, but a few studies are worth discussing in detail.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Jones Luong and Sierra (<label for="tufte-mn-49" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-49" class="margin-toggle">2015<span class="marginnote">Jones Luong, Pauline, and Jazmín Sierra. 2015. “The Domestic Political Conditions for International Economic Expansion Lessons from Latin American National Oil Companies.” <em>Comparative Political Studies</em> 48 (14): 2010–43. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414015592647">https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414015592647</a>.</span>)</span> investigate reasons for NOC internationalization head on through a small-n comparative case approach focusing in particular on Latin American NOCs. Their response variable is a factor capturing each firm’s degree of internationalization, coded as Low, Medium, or High. This variable is based on three components: the <em>scope of a firm’s foreign operations</em>, the <em>degree of foreign investment</em>, and the <em>profitability of those investments</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scope of foreign operations</em>: operationalized as the number of regions an NOC operates in and the number of activities the NOC is involved in overseas (activities being things like exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution). The authors code this based on NOC annual reports, 2000–2010.</li>
<li><em>Degree of foreign investment</em>: operationalized as the ratio of foreign assets to total assets. This ratio is based on UNCTAD Reports on Transnational Corporations, as well as NOC annual reports.</li>
<li><em>Profitability of foreign investments</em>: operationalized as foreign revenue as a percentage of total revenue. This is coded based on Security &amp; Exchange Commission Form 20F releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This measure, while exceptionally useful, has some important limitations. First, the approach relies on a significant amount of hand coding of primary source documents, annual reports in particular. In addition to being arduous work, data availability is a concern: many NOCs do not publicly release an annual report. Second, the factor and index nature of the measure obscure important variation in the data. By summarizing the measure into three levels, Jones luong and Sierra are losing valuable granular information about how internationalization varies from firm to firm. And by combining several elements into an index, it becomes difficult to identify how the components relate (or whether certain components are driving the overall index more than others).</p>
<p><span class="citation">Cheon (<label for="tufte-mn-50" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-50" class="margin-toggle">2019<span class="marginnote">Cheon, Andrew. 2019. “Developing Global Champions: Why National Oil Companies Expand Abroad.” <em>Economics &amp; Politics</em> 0 (0). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ecpo.12133">https://doi.org/10.1111/ecpo.12133</a>.</span>)</span> tackles a similar question with different data. He takes a quantitative approach to understanding variation in internationalization across the population of NOCs. He tests a number of hypotheses on mergers &amp; acquisitions data accessed through GlobalData’s E-Tracks M&amp;A database. The unit of analysis is a specific transaction, which is then coded for relevant features (including date, transacting parties, type of asset, etc.). E-Tracks data have a number of attractive features. Because transactions are dated, the data give a longitudinal view of investment activity. Additionally, the dataset is quite large and a substantial amount of detail is captured for each transaction.</p>
<p>However, these data have some shortcomings worth considering. First, transaction values are only available for a subset of observations, leaving the researcher with a choice of either using the subset with dollar values indicated or replace an interest in transaction value with volume (operationalized as a count of transactions). This approach is not able to differentiate between small and large transactions. Second, firm identifiers are not consistently coded in the data; nor is it immediately apparent whether the transacting party is a parent firm or a subsidiary of another entity. Both of these factors make it difficult to accurately link specific transactions back to the right corporate entity. Third, investments often involve a number of transacting parties, of which only one might be an NOC; parsing out these multi-party transactions is difficult, involves substantial manual effort, and raises many opportunities for coder error. Fourth, the sources of these data are industry reports and press releases: this raises the concern that some firms may be systematically under-represented in the data. A final consideration is that the researchers have not made this dataset publicly available at this point in time.</p>
