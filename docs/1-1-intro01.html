<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In December of 2014, the Russian government engaged a drastic interest rate hike in the hopes of defending the ruble. There are a number of reasons for the Russian currency’s precipitous decline in recent months — these include the stock market cost of military adventurism in Ukraine and the general decline in oil prices. The drop in the ruble’s value in mid-December, however, has been linked by observers to an “opaque deal involving the central bank and the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft” <span class="citation">(Kramer <label for="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">2014<span class="marginnote">Kramer, Andrew E. 2014. “Russia’s Steep Rate Increase Fails to Stem Ruble’s Decline.” <em>The New York Times</em>, December 16, 2014. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/russia-ruble-interest-rates.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/russia-ruble-interest-rates.html</a>.</span>)</span>. The oil company, <em>The New York Times</em> goes on to report, “had been clamoring for months for a government bailout to refinance debt the company ran up while making acquisitions when oil prices were high.”</p>
<p>A little earlier in the year, news broke in Canada that a major corruption and embezzlement scandal within the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) would slow a project in Alberta’s Athabasca oil sands involving its subsidiary PetroChina <span class="citation">(Jones <label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">2014<span class="marginnote">Jones, Jeffrey. 2014. “China Faces Buyer’s Remorse in Canada’s Oil Patch.” The Globe and Mail.

Political intrigue at home became a major story in the resource-rich Canadian province. More broadly, Chinese state-owned firms are under intense scrutiny for the declining value of their recent purchases in the Albertan oil sands. China isn’t the only foreign state investing in the oil sands: all of the top ten foreign investment deals in the Canadian energy industry have been made by state-owned firms, and six of those involved a non-Chinese state-owned enterprise.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> <span class="citation">(“The Largest Foreign Investment Deals Made in the Canadian Energy Industry” <label for="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">2014<span class="marginnote">“The Largest Foreign Investment Deals Made in the Canadian Energy Industry.” 2014.

<p>Risky investments and corruption intrigue are part of the story for all types of business; what these stories capture, anecdotally at least, are some of the complications of state-ownership over large economic entities. They also hint at an increasingly-important underlying phenomena: the international exposure of Rosneft and PetroChina are specific illustrations of the international investment and activity engaged in by state-owned energy firms (SOEs).</p>
<p>These anecdotes distill key themes this research aims to investigate empirically. At the core of each is the efforts of a state-owned oil company to acquire an international asset. While in these illustrative stories this attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, NOCs have in fact been active players in the international economy, buying and selling assets at all points in the oil &amp; gas value chain. Some, but certainly not all, NOCs have made efforts to grow internationally. The observable variation in this process of internationalization, and explanations as to its origins and features, are at the core of this study. What is NOC internationalization? How extensive is it? How does it differ from the internationalization pursued by non-state-owned energy firms?</p>
<p>The second key theme these anecdotes express is that this process of internationalization can have a highly salient, even controversial, political component to it. Large cross-border acquisitions always have at least the potential to be politically charged; this is especially true when the acquiring entity is intrinsically linked to a foreign government. Even the potential for political influence regularly raises hackles. Worried observers and regulators may not always be able to explicitly define the nature of their concern about this state influence, but they acknowledge and act on the basis of it nonetheless. This political component deserves careful empirical attention. The investment activity of SOEs is a significant element in their already well established identities as international political actors. Oil &amp; gas CEOs, energy ministers, and top regulatory officials feature prominently in the daily record of global politics. While the best known brands in international energy are private multinationals — Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil — firms owned by state actors wield substantial influence. SOEs occupy 7 of the top 10 spots in Forbes’ 2019 of largest oil &amp; gas firms; the top three spots are all held by SOEs. The contemporary reality is that the majority of global fossil fuels are produced by large firms owned by the state. We think of these firms for the most part as sellers, supplying less well-endowed states with the raw materials integral to building and sustaining a modern economy, but they are increasingly active as buyers and investors as well. This activity is a critical component of the international economic system, and has critically important international political consequences.</p>
<p>Addressing questions about NOC internationalization is important. However, our ability to systematically understand this process of NOC internationalization, and make sense of its political salience, has to date been hampered by a lack of good data on the subject. Internationalization is in fact an accumulation of specific acquisitions, mergers, and subsidiary creation events spread across a diverse set of internationalizing and target entities. Transactions of this nature are difficult to capture, especially when they occur in jurisdictions with less stringent reporting and filing regulations than the United States or Western Europe.</p>
<p>In this paper I introduce a new dataset of internationalization in the energy sector, one that focuses on the corporate hierarchies of oil &amp; gas firms.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> Collected using Standard &amp; Poor’s <a href="http://marketintelligence.spglobal.com">Capital IQ financial Database</a>.</span> Rather than focusing on transactions, this dataset exploits the detailed corporate hierarchy information that financial databases have accumulated over time on major economic entities. This dataset captures the first order subsidiaries of all NOCs, and a sample of the most important privately owned (or publicly traded) oil &amp; gas firms globally. These data capture internationalization in a global network of parent and subsidiary relationships.</p>
<p>These data represent a significant addition to empirical efforts to capture and analyze NOC internationalization, pursued in recent years by researchers at the intersection of political economy and business studies. Researchers have addressed the substantive questions at hand with a variety of empirical approaches. Several have pursued within-country analyses leveraging detailed firm-level data to address questions of internationalization within the context of a specific state <span class="citation">(eg.

There are benefits and disadvantages to each of these empirical approaches; a more complete discussion of how the new data introduced in this chapter relate to existing datasets is undertaken in section (<a href="1-3-approach01.html#approach01">1.3</a>).</p>
<p>Using these data, we develop a set of novel findings that improve or understanding of NOC internationalization.</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of NOCs have acquired or established at least one international international subsidiary; 80% of NOC subsidiaries are owned by 10% of iNOCs.</li>
<li>NOCs that have internationalized have done so in a set of discrete and identifiable patterns, allowing us to generate a typology of NOC internationalization</li>
<li>NOC internationalization differs systematically from IOC internationalization: NOCs establish an international subsidiary network in politically-similar, geographically adjacent states.</li>
<li>NOCs are less likely than IOCs to pursue JVs or other shared partnerships, preferring wholly-owned vehicles</li>
<li>NOCs are just as likely to acquire or establish subsidiaries for resource extraction as for other prospects down the energy value chain, such as refining or distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these findings represent a significant improvement in our foundational understanding of how NOCs operate across borders in the contemporary economy. NOCs are some of the most materially significant economic entities operating today: they control X% of known oil &amp; gas reserves, and 8/10 of the Fortune 500 2018 list. Establishing the empirical contours of how they exist as international actors is an essential part of properly accounting for their role in theories of economic nationalism, globalization, foreign direct investment flows, and domestic economic and political development (resource-influenced or otherwise). From a political economy perspective, the case can be made that contemporary state capitalism and economic nationalism are under-theorized. A better empirical understanding of some of the most important entities in this context is an essential part of rectifying that gap. A further discussion of these points is developed in Section <a href="1-5-conclusion01.html#conclusion01">1.5</a>.</p>
<p>This chapter proceeds as follows. In the next section (<a href="1-2-motiv01.html#motiv01">1.2</a>) we motivate this research by discussing the state of the literature on NOC internationalization. While some political scientists are investigating this problem set, the bulk of contemporary work on the international dimensions of state-ownership lie in business studies. This relative neglect from political scientists is unwarranted, we argue, and a renewed focus stands as a nice complement to existing comparative strands of research. We also spend some time motivating the empirical approach taken in this paper in light of existing efforts to understand these phenomena.</p>
<p>Section <a href="1-3-approach01.html#approach01">1.3</a> introduces our dataset more fully. We discuss the data collection method, address specific areas of improvement over existing or complementary datasets, and conduct some preliminary exploratory analysis to establish a clear basis for proceeding.</p>
<p>Section <a href="1-4-analysis01.html#analysis01">1.4</a> utilizes the dataset introduced in the preceding section to improve our understanding of NOC internationalization along a number of complementary empirical (albeit descriptive rather than strictly inferential) lines. It also investigates a central question: does NOC status has a substantive and statistically significant relationship with subsidiary political affinity? In order to test this hypothesis, we leverage state dyad ideal points data coded by <span class="citation">Bailey, Strezhnev, and Voeten (<label for="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">2017<span class="marginnote">Bailey, Michael A., Anton Strezhnev, and Erik Voeten. 2017. “Estimating Dynamic State Preferences from United Nations Voting Data.” <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em> 61 (2): 430–56. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002715595700">https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002715595700</a>.</span>)</span>. A more complete discussion of these data is provided in the empirical approach section.</p>
<p>The concluding section (<a href="1-5-conclusion01.html#conclusion01">1.5</a>) discusses the implications, as well as the limitations, of this research. It also explicitly connects this research with other salient lines of inquiry, several of which are pursued in distinct chapters within this study.</p>
