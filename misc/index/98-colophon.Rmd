# Colophon {-}

This document is set in [EB Garamond](https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond), [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/) and [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/). The body text is set at 11pt with $\familydefault$.

It was written in R Markdown and $\LaTeX$, and rendered into PDF (and HTML) using [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). It was typeset using the XeTeX typesetting system. The TeX template used to ensure that this document meets the submission standards of the institution is heavily indebted to the Georgetown University $\LaTeX$ template and the University of Washington $\LaTeX$ template, and to Ben Marwick's heavy lifting in the `huskydown` package.

This version of the thesis was generated on `r Sys.time()`.
