\abstract{National Oil Companies (NOCs) were initially built to give states
control over their domestic hydrocarbon resources, but many of them have
now acquired assets and established subsidiaries outside of their home
state. This dissertation adresses three key questions related to this
phenomenon. First, how does NOC internationalization vary? Second, why
are some NOCs highly internationalized and others aren't? Third, what
are the political consequences of NOC internationalization? In
addressing these questions, this research sheds light on a set of
integral but under-theorized institutions, NOCs, which are at the centre
of contemporary state capitalism and the political economy of
hydrocarbon resource wealth.}

\acknowledgments{I have accumulated many debts in the course of researching and writing
this dissertation.

Thanks are due, firstly, to Eric Voeten for his guidance, support, and
encouragement throughout this process. I am also grateful to the many
other mentors in the Georgetown community and beyond: these include in
particular George Shambaugh, Nathan Jensen, and Paasha Mahdavi, but also
Dan Nexon, Andrew Bennett, and Dan Hopkins.

I must also thank all of my colleagues who offered numerous helpful
suggestions, stimulating conversations, and extensive support
(intellectual, material, psychological). Chiefly -- but of course not
exclusively -- Geoffrey Sigalet, Rebecca Lissner, Adam Mount, Mohit
Grover, and Noel Anderson played important roles at key points in this
project's development. I am very fortunate to have had you all as
friends and colleagues.

My family has been extremely supportive throughout the process, whether
or not they believed it would ever be finished. It wouldn't have been,
except that I am blessed with a wonderful spouse. Kelly, your patience,
encouragement, unflagging support throughout my time researching and
writing made the difference. Thank you.}

\chapter*{Introduction to this
Dissertation}\label{introduction-to-this-dissertation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction to this Dissertation}

This section gives a 1,000 ft. overview of the dissertation as a whole.
It has two key objectives. First, it is designed to provide a ``coles
notes'' for the dissertation, clearly stating both the key questions and
findings for all three substantive chapters. Second, should establish as
clearly as possible how this dissertation addresses problems at the core
of international political economy -- that is, it needs to establish
disciplinary fit.

\chapter{What is NOC Internationalization?}\label{paper1}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro01}

In December of 2014, the Russian government engaged a drastic interest
rate hike in the hopes of defending the ruble. There are a number of
reasons for the Russian currency's precipitous decline in recent months
--- these include the stock market cost of military adventurism in
Ukraine and the general decline in oil prices. The drop in the ruble's
value in mid-December, however, has been linked by observers to an
``opaque deal involving the central bank and the state-controlled oil
company, Rosneft''" (Kramer,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kramer_russias_2014}{2014}). The oil company,
\emph{The New York Times} goes on to report, ``had been clamoring for
months for a government bailout to refinance debt the company ran up
while making acquisitions when oil prices were high.''

\chapter{Why do some NOCs go global?}\label{paper2}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro02}

Nigeria and Angola are the two largest oil producers in Africa, and
their NOCs (NNPC and Sonangol, respectively) are two of the most
important domestic economic institutions. Both countries have
significant levels of international investment into their oil sectors.
Both experienced devastating civil conflict until early in the 21st
century. Nigeria has a much larger population and economy; Angola
performs better, comparatively speaking, on indexes that measure
corruption and investment risk.
